xcfas with AI Chatbot

## Tech Stack

- **Framework**: Next.js 15 (App Router)
- **Authentication**: Supabase Auth
- **Database**: Supabase (PostgreSQL)
- **API**: REST API with fetch
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS + shadcn/ui
- **Color Scheme**: gold
- **AI Template**: AI Chatbot (Anthropic Claude)
- **Deployment**: vercel

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 20 or higher
- npm, yarn, or pnpm
- Anthropic Claude API key (for AI features)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository** (if applicable)

2. **Install dependencies**

```bash
npm install
```

3. **Set up environment variables**

Copy the `.env.example` file to `.env.local`:

```bash
cp .env.example .env.local
```

Then fill in the required values. You must add your `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` to use AI features.

For detailed setup instructions for authentication, database, and AI features, see [SETUP.md](./SETUP.md).

4. **Start the development server**

```bash
npm run dev
```

5. **Open your browser**

Navigate to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to see your application.

6. **Try the AI features**

Visit http://localhost:3000/chat to test your AI integration.

7. **Test authentication**

Visit http://localhost:3000/auth/login to sign in and access the dashboard at http://localhost:3000/dashboard

## Security Best Practices

### Dependency Management

This project uses exact dependency versions in `package.json` for security and reproducibility.

**Regular Security Audits:**

```bash
# Check for known vulnerabilities
npm audit

# Fix vulnerabilities automatically (when possible)
npm audit fix

# For more detailed analysis
npm audit --json
```

**Updating Dependencies:**

```bash
# Check for outdated packages
npm outdated

# Update specific package
npm update package-name

# Update all packages (be careful, test thoroughly)
npm update
```

**Recommended Schedule:**
- Run `npm audit` weekly
- Review and update dependencies monthly
- Always test after updates

### Environment Variables

- **Never commit** `.env.local` or `.env` files
- Use different secrets for development and production
- Rotate API keys regularly, especially if exposed
- Use secret management services in production (AWS Secrets Manager, etc.)

### Authentication Security


- Keep auth secrets secure and rotate them regularly
- Use strong, randomly generated secrets (minimum 32 characters)
- Enable 2FA on all service accounts (GitHub, Google, etc.)
- Review OAuth scopes - only request what you need
- Monitor authentication logs for suspicious activity


### API Security

- Rate limit API endpoints to prevent abuse
- Validate all user input
- Use HTTPS in production (enforced by default)
- Implement proper error handling (don't leak sensitive info)
- Keep API keys secure and monitor usage

### Database Security


- Use connection pooling to prevent exhaustion
- Implement proper access controls and permissions
- Regularly backup your database
- Use parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection
- Encrypt sensitive data at rest


### Docker Security

- If you use Docker, follow container security best practices

### Reporting Security Issues

If you discover a security vulnerability:

1. **Do not** open a public issue
2. Email security concerns privately
3. Include detailed reproduction steps
4. Allow time for fixes before public disclosure

## Troubleshooting

### AI Features Not Working

**API Key Issues:**
- Verify the key is correctly copied from [Anthropic Claude Console](https://console.anthropic.com/)
- Check that there are no extra spaces in the `.env.local` file
- Ensure the key starts with `sk-ant-`
- Verify you're using the correct environment variable: `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`
- Restart the development server after adding the key

**Rate Limiting:**
- Check your usage limits in the Anthropic Claude Console
- Wait a few minutes before retrying if you hit rate limits
- Consider upgrading your plan for higher limits

**Response Issues:**
- Check the browser console for error messages
- Verify your account has sufficient credits/quota
- Ensure the API endpoint is accessible (check network tab)
- Try a simpler prompt to test basic functionality

### Authentication Issues

- Verify all auth environment variables are set correctly
- Check that OAuth callback URLs match your configuration
- Ensure the auth secret is properly generated
- Clear browser cookies and try again

### Database Connection Issues

- Verify the DATABASE_URL is correctly formatted
- Check that the database server is running
- Ensure network connectivity to the database
- Verify database credentials are correct

### Environment Variables Not Loading

- Restart the development server after changing `.env.local`
- Verify the file is named exactly `.env.local` (not `.env`)
- Check that the file is in the project root directory
- Ensure variables are not commented out

### Getting Help

If you encounter issues not covered here:

1. Check the documentation for the specific technology
2. Search for similar issues on GitHub
3. Review the error messages carefully for clues
